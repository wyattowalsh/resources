## Introduction

The Resources Collection App is a beautifully stylized collection of resources. It includes a master resource data file, a script to generate the README, and a Next.js 15 static site for GitHub Pages to present the information in addition to the README.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the resource and star data JSON files.
- `components/`: Contains the React components used in the app.
- `pages/`: Contains the Next.js pages.
- `styles/`: Contains the global styles for the app.
- `scripts/`: Contains the Python scripts for GitHub Actions.
- `.github/workflows/`: Contains the GitHub Actions workflows.
- `pyproject.toml`: Configuration file for Python dependencies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or later
- Python 3.13
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wyattowalsh/resources.git
   cd resources
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the App

To run the app locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Components

### ResourceForm

The `ResourceForm` component is used to add new resources. It includes input fields for various resource attributes such as `notes`, `date-last-accessed`, `summary`, `image`, `tags`, `url`, and `relationships`. The form also allows for JSON upload and includes enums and pickers for categorical fields.

### StarHistoryGraph

The `StarHistoryGraph` component displays a beautiful GitHub star history graph within a drop-down. It uses Framer Motion for animations and transitions and fetches star-related data from the flat file `star-data.json`.

### StarCountDisplay

The `StarCountDisplay` component displays the current GitHub star count. It fetches star-related data from the flat file `star-data.json` and updates the star count nightly via a GitHub Action.

## Data Schema

### Resource Schema

The resource schema is defined in `data/resources-schema.json`. It includes fields such as `notes`, `date-last-accessed`, `summary`, `image`, `tags`, `url`, and `relationships`. The schema is flexible and allows for new tags to be added.

### Star Data Schema

The star data schema is defined in `data/star-data.json`. It includes metadata and star data for multiple projects. The schema is validated using Pydantic in the Python scripts.

## GitHub Actions

The project includes a GitHub Action workflow to update the star data nightly. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/update-star-data.yml` and uses Python to fetch star data from the GitHub GraphQL API.

## Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn-UI for UI components. The styles are consistent with the color scheme and design principles to ensure a visually appealing interface.
